Built in MeteorJS/NodeJS/ReactJS (I like Javascript)

Basic blog, allows creating an account and signing in, posting blogs, commenting on blogs, searching blogs, and subscribing to a newsletter (WIP)


The frontend is written in React and the backend is written in Node/MeteorJS. Meteor allows for a lot of the account handling. Mailchimp is used for the newsletter. The database is mongodb. Meteor allows the creation of easy to use schemas to work with mongodb. There are also some other meteor packages used like modals. Meteor also allows the frontend and backend to communicate simultaneously without the need for an independent API.
